          <h3>The use of the grid as an ordering system is the expression of a certain mental attitude inasmuch as it shows that the <a class="annotation_1">designer conceives his work</a> in terms that are constructive and oriented to the future.</h3>

          <h3>This is the expression of a professional ethos: the designer’s work should have the clearly intelligible, objective, functional, and aesthetic quality of mathematical thinking.</h3>
            
          <h3>His work should thus be a contribution to general culture and itself form part of it.</h3>
            
          <h3>Constructivist design that is capable of analysis and reproduction can influence and enhance the taste of a society and the way it conceives forms and colors. Design that is objective, committed to the common weal, well composed, and refined constitutes the basis of democratic behavior.</h3>
            
          <h3>Constructivist design means the conversion of design laws into practical solutions. Work done systematically and in accordance with strict formal principles makes those demands for directness, intelligibility, and the integration of all factors that are also vital in sociopolitical life.</h3>
            
          <h3>Working with the grid system means submitting to laws of universal validity.</h3>
            
          <h3>The use of the grid system implies the will to systematize, to clarify</h3>
            
          <h3>the will to penetrate to the essentials, to concentrate</h3>
            
          <h3>the will to cultivate objectivity instead of subjectivity</h3>
            
          <h3>the will to rationalize the creative and technical production processes</h3>
            
          <h3>the will to integrate elements of color, form, and material</h3>
            
          <h3>the will to achieve architectural dominion over surface and space</h3>
            
          <h3>the will to adopt a positive, forward-looking attitude</h3>
            
          <h3>the recognition of the importance of education and the effect of work devised in a constructive and creative spirit.</h3>

          <h3>Every visual creative work is a manifestation of the character of the designer. It is a reflection of his knowledge, his ability, and his mentality.</h3>
